# ProjectPlanning

## Overview
**ProjectPlanning** is a web-based system designed to manage and orchestrate collaborative projects through process modeling with **Bonita BPM**.  
The platform allows organizations to register projects, define coverage requests (such as financial aid, materials, or workforce), and interact with NGOs or collaborators that can commit resources to support these initiatives.

The goal of the project is to integrate a user-friendly **.NET web application** with the **Bonita BPM engine**, enabling seamless interaction between project organizers and service providers while ensuring that all processes follow a clear and automated workflow.
